It's more or less a direct translation of the Java StandardTripsModule and KQML
libraries to Python. However a few minor differences make it not a drop-in
replacement for using the Java libraries from Jython:

 * Module and method names are in snake_case instead of camelCase (class names
   are still in CamelCase).
 * The class you want to extend is TripsModule, not StandardTripsModule; there
   is no StandardTripsModule.
 * There's no run() method; init() is called from __init__(), and there's a
   start() method that starts the dispatcher. So call start() instead of run().
 * There's no get(i) method in KQMLList; use list[i] instead of list.get(i).
 * KQMLReader seeks backwards to implement unget_char, which fails when running
   a module alone from the console with -connect no (you can't seek stdin).
 * You *can* set self.name, it's not protected by Java.
